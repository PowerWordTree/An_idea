# **Building Digital Native Intelligence from Scratch: An Experimental Blueprint Based on Evolving Simulated Neurons**

I have been thinking about a question recently:  
**If we do not begin with large models, training data, or predefined architectures, but instead start from “zero” and allow a population of simulated neurons to evolve spontaneously within a closed environment, could some form of primitive intelligence eventually emerge?**

This is not code-based life, not self-modifying software, and not a dangerous digital organism.  
It is a **controlled, closed, and accelerable digital evolution experiment**.

Below is a directional blueprint I have organized. Discussion, critique, and extensions are welcome.

## **1. Why Build Intelligence from Zero?**

Despite their impressive capabilities, current AI systems exhibit several fundamental limitations:

- Lack of persistent internal state  
- Lack of behavioral consistency  
- Lack of homeostatic mechanisms  
- Lack of intrinsic “style”  
- Lack of evolutionary history  

They behave more like **tools** than **entities**.

In contrast, even the simplest biological organisms—such as worms—possess:

- Internal state  
- Homeostasis  
- Behavioral tendencies  
- Structural evolution  
- Environmental adaptation  

This leads to a natural question:

> **Can we simulate evolution in the digital domain and allow intelligent structures to emerge naturally rather than being manually designed?**

## **2. Core Idea: A Digital Neuron Ecosystem Under Evolutionary Pressure**

The goal is not to train a model, but to:

> **Construct a population of minimally functional simulated neurons that can spontaneously connect, organize, replicate, and be eliminated within a closed environment, eventually evolving into intelligent structures.**

These “neurons” are neither biological neurons nor deep learning nodes. They are abstract computational units that:

- Maintain simple internal state  
- Receive and emit signals  
- Form and break connections  
- Replicate or die under defined rules  

Intelligence is not engineered; it is:

- **Structurally emergent**  
- **Behaviorally accumulated**  
- **A product of long-term evolution**  

This is essentially a **digital evolutionary experiment**.

## **3. Experimental Environment: Closed, Controllable, Accelerable**

The system is inherently closed:

- No interaction with the external world  
- No access to external resources  
- No code-level self-modification  
- Fully pausable, resettable, and replayable  
- Evolutionary time can be accelerated through compute  

This enables something nature cannot provide:

> **Observing thousands or even millions of generations within real-world time.**

## **4. Evolutionary Dynamics: From Chaos to Structure, from Loops to Intelligence**

Early stages will likely be chaotic:

- Random neural connections  
- Meaningless behavior  
- Frequent structural collapse  
- Or stagnation in simple loops  

These are not failures—they are the starting point of evolution.

When the system stagnates, we can introduce:

- Additional stimuli  
- Increased environmental complexity  
- Resource competition  
- Extended time horizons  
- New feedback dimensions  

to break cycles and push evolution forward.

Over time, we may observe:

- Subnetwork replication  
- Stabilization of local structures  
- Longer behavioral sequences  
- Emergence of simple preferences  
- Improved recovery after perturbations  

When these phenomena persist, we can consider the system to have reached:

> **The early form of “worm-level intelligence.”**

## **5. Failure Modes and Elimination Mechanisms: An Open Design Space**

Evolution may fail in many ways:

- Structural degradation  
- Overactivation  
- Structural freezing  
- Excessive complexity  
- Environmental mismatch  

Elimination mechanisms should not be fixed in advance; they form part of the experimenter’s design space. Examples include:

- Energy depletion  
- Ineffective behavior  
- Structural instability  
- Lower fitness relative to competitors  

Different elimination rules may lead to different forms of intelligence.

## **6. Levels of Intelligence: Starting with Worm-Level and Expanding Gradually**

This blueprint is not about “building AGI in one step.”  
It is a staged exploration.

### **Stage 1: Worm-Level Intelligence (Core Goal)**

- Simple preferences  
- Homeostasis  
- Behavioral consistency  
- Recovery from perturbations  
- Basic strategies  

### **Stage 2: Small-Animal Intelligence (Optional Extension)**

- Long-term memory  
- Multi-objective behavior  
- Simple planning  
- Context switching  

### **Stage 3: Higher Intelligence (Long-Term Exploration)**

- World modeling  
- Causal reasoning  
- Internal simulation  

Whether the system can reach mammalian-level intelligence is **unknown and unnecessary to promise**.

## **7. Value Along the Way: Extracting “Intelligent Structures” at Every Stage**

Even if the system never surpasses worm-level intelligence, we can extract:

- Homeostatic control structures  
- Behavioral consistency modules  
- Preference modeling structures  
- Simple planning mechanisms  
- Environmental adaptation structures  

These can be applied to:

- Smart home systems  
- Small robots  
- Environmental management  
- Long-term consistent AI  
- Automation systems  

This path is not a gamble on AGI. It is:

> **A route that continuously produces usable intelligent building blocks.**

## **8. Not a Procedure, but an Open Blueprint**

To avoid constraining creativity, this blueprint intentionally avoids specifying:

- Concrete algorithms  
- Specific parameters  
- Exact environments  
- Training procedures  

Instead, it provides:

- **Direction**  
- **Framework**  
- **Key concepts**  
- **Design dimensions**  
- **Possible pathways**  

Researchers can design their own experiments based on this blueprint.

## **9. Conclusion: Discussion and Exploration Welcome**

The purpose of this proposal is not to provide definitive answers, but to:

- Offer a new research direction  
- Provide a controllable framework for evolving intelligence  
- Establish a path that yields value at every stage  
- Create an open starting point for exploration  

If this blueprint inspires experiments, papers, open-source projects, or educational tools, all the better.
